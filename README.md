# Kata repository
## Description

Here I will be uploading the JavaScript practice exercises from the page [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). In this repository, there will not be implemented tests, only the solutions to the exercises. For the tests, you can go to my repository of [kata with tests](https://github.com/estefaniaramirezmnt/Katas-with-tests)

For now, there is two levels of difficulty: **easy** (*8 kyu and 7 kyu*) and **medium** (*6 kyu and 5 kyu*). I will be adding more levels as I solve more exercises.

If you need to run them, you can copy them into your Visual Studio Code. I recommend you to have the Code Runner extension.

Thank you for reading me!
